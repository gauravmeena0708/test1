=====

Just a repo to test new technologies like web rtc, web sockets and node.js


## Requirements ##
* socket.io+ 
* Internet connection to send POST request to Github API

## How to test ##
Install node.js from http://nodejs.org/  
You can test the application by running it through node.js command prompt  
```
node app.js
```

Now go to your browser and type `http://localhost:8080/`

## Other things ##
nodemon is a useful module, which tracks js files and restarts the node project if any changes are made 
```
npm install -g nodemon
```
socket.io used in this page may become old so you can just uninstall it, and reinstall new

npm uninstall socket.io
npm install socket.io
```
